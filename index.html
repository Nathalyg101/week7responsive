                    <h4>24' Dragon Vector Art</h4>
                    <p><img src="assets/24_Dragon-72dpi.jpg" alt="Vector illustration of a dragon for 
                        the 2024 year and lunar year."></p>
                    <p><b>24' Dragon Vector Art</b> is a personal work I developed on my own.
                        The purpose behind was to celebrate the new year, while doing some research I 
                        discovered 2024 would be the year of the dragon in the chinese lunar calendar. So 
                        as to represent both special occasions, I came up with the idea of integrating a 
                        dragon into my work and combine its body with the number 24.</p>

                    <p><b>Vinyl Cover Design</b> is a cover design developed based on the song of my choice <i>Racing into the night by Yoasobi.</i> 
                        Gathering teenagers and young adults who enjoy foreign music and things with greater meaning and/or significance. As well as to 
                        challenge visual appeals and consider characters and their actions critically. By using illustration as a vital component to 
                        showcase both sides of the song through color, illustration, and typography.</p>

                    <h4>WWF Campaign</h4>
                    <p><img src="assets/WWF_Final-72dpi.jpg" alt="Vector Illustration based campaign for WWF using Pikachu"></p>
                    <p><b>WWF campaign</b> was built around WWF's values and branding elements to raise awareness about endangered species, with
                    the target audience being kids, I worked to develop ideas and collaborations that would attarct both kids and parents attentions.
                    Therefore, I chose to team up with pokémon in order to raise awareness and bring that curiousity and joy kids get from watching and 
                    learning about their favorite pokémon!</p>
